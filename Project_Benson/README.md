> Identifying and Optimizing Routes for a fictional shuttle service

![Benson Build Status][buildstatus-url]

My team and I used exploratory data analysis techniques to analyze New York's MTA turnstile data to determine commuter patterns and schedules. We leveraged this knowledge to build out a ride scheduler for Qubra, a fictional startup we created that provides a shuttle service directly between Queens and Brooklyn.

**Data Source:** [MTA Turnstile Data](wwww.google.com)

**Model:** Linear Regression

**Conclusion:** TBD
