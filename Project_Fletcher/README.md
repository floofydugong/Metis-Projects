**Project:** Fletcher

**Description:** Determined DOTA 2 highlights using TF-IDF and Latent Semantic Analysis on Twitch chat logs. Monitored chat traffic patterns using a D3 dashboard.

# Problem Statement

I will be scraping twitch chat data from past recordings of streams related to Dota 2. Through NLP, I will work to build a model that can identify key events that occur during the game through chat spikes, word choice, and topics being discussed. This information will then be displayed on a dashboard that lets users scrub through a video to view highlights of the game.
