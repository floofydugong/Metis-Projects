**Project:** Kojak

**Problem Statement:** Classified ads from Backpage.com using Naive Bayes to determine potential human trafficking victims. Built a flask app to display truthfulness/deceitfulness of ads, incorporating javascript and CSS elements.

**Data Source:** 320 Hand labeled Backpage.com escort ads in San Francisco.

**Your Model:** I used a Multinomial Naive Bayes model in with the output of a Count Vectorizer as the input to predict whether or not the ad was fradulent.

**Conclusion:** The model was able to predict with 80% accuracy. Althougn this is a great milestone, the data that I scraped and labeled inherently had bias. For future work, I would like to consult law enforcement agencies and NGO's to develop a truth set.
